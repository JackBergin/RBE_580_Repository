# RBE580-Work

This repository holds 2 folders in its primary directory. The first is for Methods 1-2 analysis 
in determining valid training images for the detection algorithm being developed. The following
image is one of the 406 plots that were utilized in determining if the points created were valid
(on the needle) and if the needle was in the full frame of the image.

The second folder is the progress, results, and ds I have used for my progress on Method III. Shown
below are the several different cells organized based on functions they provide to the overall
training and testing of the Detectron2 algorithm and pipeline created to our Roboflow Dataset.
